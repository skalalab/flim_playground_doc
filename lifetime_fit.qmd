# Lifetime Features (Fit)
After [calibration for IRF shift](numerical_feature_extraction.qmd#fit-calibration),

## Preprocessing 


FLIM Playground extracts cell-level lifetime fitting features by summing up all the pixel decays belonging to the same cell ROI [@samimi25] labeled by the ROI [mask](data_extraction.qmd#mask) as one decay curve.
