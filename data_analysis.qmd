# Overview
We are not done yet ðŸ˜±! FLIM Playground also provides a suite of methods to analyze and visualize the extracted data (either using the [Data Extraction](data_extraction.qmd) module or in user's own way). They are designed to be interactive and frictionless âš¡ so that users can perform hassel-free exploration of their data with, hopefully, fun ðŸ˜Ž. 

# Design
Columns of any tabular data can be categorized into three sets:

- identifiers: unique row identifier and (optional) field of view identifier
- categorical features: conceptually help us group the rows (e.g. the catetegorical feature `treatment` will group the rows into different treatment groups)
- numerical features: quantify the differences between data groups

The [Data Extraction](data_extraction.qmd) module is designed to extract data in this fashion so that the [Data Analysis](data_analysis.qmd) module can take advantage of: it designs an [architectural blueprint](#shared-interactive-widgets) that all analysis methods can build on based on the above categorization. Therefore, the design of FLIM Playground is modularized so that new methods and features can be added in the future.  

# Methods
- Depending on the number of numerical features in the analysis, the methods are categorized into 3 groups: 
    - Univariate Analysis
        - [Feature Comparison](feature_comparison.qmd)
        - [Feature Histogram](feature_histogram.qmd)
        - [Field of View Comparison](fov_comparison.qmd)
    - Bivariate Analysis
        - [2D Feature Distribution](feature_distribution.qmd)
        - [Phasor Analysis](phasor_analysis.qmd)
    - Multivariate Analysis
        - [Dimension Reduction](dimension_reduction.qmd)
        - [Classification](classification.qmd)

All the methods [share a set of interactive widgets](#shared-interactive-widgets) to support the [general workflow](#general-workflow). They also have their own method-specific widgets, the descriptions of which are provided in the corresponding method pages.

## Requirements
::: {.callout-important}

In either case, following the [design](#design), the dataset should have:

- a column that uniquely identifies each row
- an (optional) field of view identifier column  
- a set of numerical features
- zero or more categorical features (e.g. treatment, day, patient id, etc.)

:::

The unique row id and field of view id are used to help user identify the row (e.g. a single cell) and field of view (e.g. a single image) of data of interest through the built-in [hover-based interaction](#unique-id-hover). Numerical and categorical features are used to render [shared widgets](#shared-interactive-widgets). Internally, FLIM Playground will check whether the dataset fulfills the requirements and output meaningful warning or error messages 

::: {.callout-note}
Warning messages will not prevent the analysis but error messages will. 
:::


## Warnings Messages
- `Empty columns`: will be dropped.
- `Duplicated columns`: Only the first occurrence of the duplicated column will be kept. Other occurrences will be dropped.
- `Duplicated rows based on the unique row id`: Only the first occurrence of the duplicated row will be kept. Other occurrences will be dropped.
- `Columns with NaN values`: won't be dropped, just a warning message. 
    - The analysis will be performed on the rows that are not NaN in the [selected numerical features](#numerical-feature-widgets). 

## Errors Messages
- Missing a column that uniquely identifies each row
- Cannot indentify any numerical feature column
    - it uses `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` to check if a column is numerical. 

# Shared Interactive Widgets

A list of shared widgets are provided to support the general workflow in analysis. 

## General Workflow

- select [numerical feature(s)](#numerical-feature-widgets) on the left
- [subset the data](#filter-widgets) to find data of interest on the top 
- use [visual channels widgets](#visual-channels-widgets) to look at the data in different ways
- change the plot [style](#plotting-configuration-widgets)
- [hover](#unique-id-hover) to find data points of interest

The visualization and analysis results will be updated in real time to reflect user's interactactions with any of the above widgets. 

## Numerical Feature Widgets 
The Data Extraction module groups numerical features based on the [feature extractor type](data_extraction.qmd#feature-extractor) and the channel it belongs to. For user-provided datasets, the numerical features will be grouped based on the [user-specified configuration](data_analysis_config.qmd). Ungrouped numerical features will be grouped into a group called `Uncategorized Features`. One selection widget will be rendered for each numerical feature group. 

### Univariate Analysis
One set of selection widgets, each can select one feature from a feature group, is rendered. If one feature from a feature group is selected, all the other features groups will be reset to the value `Select`. 

![](analysis_ui_shots/uni_select.png){width=40% fig-align=center}

### Bivariate Analysis
Two sets of selection widgets are rendered to allow maximum flexibility (the two features can be from the same or different feature groups). Each set of selection widgets behaves like the selection widgets in the univariate analysis. The first selected feature will be hidden in the second set of selection widgets. 

![](analysis_ui_shots/bi_select.png){width=40% fig-align=center}

### Multivariate Analysis
One set of selection widgets, each can select multiple features from a feature group, is rendered. A special value `All` is introduced so that the user can conveniently select all features under the feature group. If user selects `All`, all the other options will be cleared, and vice versa.

## Categorical Feature Widgets

### Filter Widgets
![](analysis_ui_shots/filter.png){width=95%}

For complex datasets that are collected over multiple days, experiments, treatments, etc., it is useful to filter the data to focus on a subset of the data (data of interest). One filter widget will be rendered for each categorical feature so that user has the flexibility to filter the data based on combinations of categorical features. `All` is a special option that will include all categories of the selected categorical feature. Once it is selected, all the other options will be cleared, and vice versa. 

### Visual Channels Widgets
![](analysis_ui_shots/vis_channels.png){width=100%}

Human vision is wired for rapid, parallel pattern and trend detection; good visual encodings (how to map data to visual elements such as color, shape, opacity, etc.) harness this to surface insights that raw numbers or text obscure [@cleveland1984]. FLIM Playground provides `color`, `opacity`, and `shape` channels for visualizations that support them: 

#### Color by
Color is supported in all methods except for [Classification](classification.qmd). In `Color by`, the user can select multiple categorical features, and each unique combination of available categories (determined by the filters in the [Filter Widgets](#filter-widgets)) in selected features will be assigned a distinct color. Groups created by `Color by` will show up in the x-axis (if multiple features, categories from each feature will be delimited by `::`).

::: {#nte-order .callout-note}
## How to order the groups
The order of the groups in x-axis and in the legend is determined by:

- the order of the selected features: categories of the first feature appears before those of the second, so on so forth. For example, the two treatments of `Panc1` are togther, because it is sorted first on the cell lines, then on treatments. If you want the treatments to be together, in `Color by` you can select `treatment` then `cell_line`. 

- *Numer-alphatical sort*: within each feature, the category order is determined by the number inside (e.g. `1` in `Panc1`), then the alphabetical order of the category name. Therefore, although `P` is after `M` alphabetically, the `1` is before `7` numerically, making `Panc1` appears before `MCF7`. This maybe helpful when you have data from different days or hours. The default string sort will put `Day 100` before `Day 30`, and this is not what we want.

#### Opacity and Shape by
- Opacity and shape is supported in all point-based visualizations (e.g. [Feature Comparison](feature_comparison.qmd), [2D Feature Distribution](feature_distribution.qmd), [Phasor Analysis](phasor_analysis.qmd), [Dimension Reduction](dimension_reduction.qmd)). In `Opacity by` and `Shape by`, the user can select one categorical feature, and each unique category will be assigned a distinct opacity or shape. The order of the shape and opacity is also sorted [numer-alphatically](#nte-order). 

![](analysis_ui_shots/opacity_shape_by.png){width=90% fig-align=center}

## Unique ID Hover
- In all point-based visualizations, when hovering over a point, the unique id of the point will be shown.

## Plotting Configuration Widgets
![](analysis_ui_shots/style.png){width=100%}

User can interactively configure the following plot parameters: 

- point size (if point-based)
- axis label size
- legend size
- the colormap used to color different groups
    - `colorblind`, `tab10`, `tab20`, `Set1`, `Set2`, `Set3`, `Pastel1`, `Pastel2`, `Accent`, `viridis`, `plasma`, `inferno`, `magma`, `cividis`
