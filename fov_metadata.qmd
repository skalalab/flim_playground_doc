# Field of View Metadata
It is the first step in the [Data Extraction](data_extraction.qmd) workflow. It organizes the metadata of each field of view (FOV), including the file paths of all required input files and decay information, into a single CSV file used in the numerical feature extraction step and user's own bookkeeping and potential troubleshooting.

It is divided into two sections: 

- The left 1/3 of the screen is the [metadata of FOVs](#metadata), inherited from the [Data Extraction Configuration](data_extraction_config.qmd) step. 
- The right 2/3 shows the extraction status for all FOVs. 

# Metadata 

Metadata are configured earlier in the [Data Extraction Configuration](data_extraction_config.qmd) step and copied here. Some fields remain editable for flexibility, while others are fixed to ensure usability. Non-editable fields can be modified in the Data Extraction Configuration step. After save the modification and go back to here and refresh the page, the changes will be reflected. 

## Decay Type

See [decay types](data_extraction_config.qmd#decay-types) for more details. The decay type is not editable here.

## Channel Names 
See [channel name config](data_extraction_config.qmd#channel-name) for more details. The names are not editable here, though the user can choose which channel to include.

## Feature Extractors

See [feature extractor config](data_extraction_config.qmd#feature-extractor) for more details. The feature extractors for each channel are shown but not editable here.

## Decay info

See [decay info config](data_extraction_config.qmd#decay-info) for more details. The decay info are editable here. 

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_decay.png){width=60% fig-align=center}

### 2D Decay-specific

Since the [2D decay](#2d-decay) file does not provide the `duration` and the number of `time bins` per laser pulse interval, the user needs to specify them.

## File Suffix

Copied from the [file suffix config](data_extraction_config.qmd#file-suffix). 
User can edit the file suffixes here.

## Reference Dye

If the selected fit free calibration method is [reference dye](data_extraction_config.qmd#calibration-method), the user can specify the reference dye file path and the refernce dye lifetime here, the default of those are copied from the reference dye config.

## Folder Path
Finally, the user can specify the folder path that contains all the required input files.

# Metadata Extraction
## FOV File Paths

The first step is to find the field of views:

- it finds all the files recursively in the folder path that ends with the 1st file suffix of the 1st channel.
- the prefix of all the matched files are considered to be the field of view name. 
    - FOV name = file name - 1st file suffix

Then, it uses the found FOV names to find all other files: 

- file name to search = FOV name + other file suffixes for each file suffix

The only exception is the calibration file, because it is not FOV-specific. They will be searched for based on the their file suffixes only. 

### Success

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_success.png){width=60% fig-align=center}

### Missing 

When it cannot find the file based on the file name (FOV name + file suffix for that file type) inside the folder path, it will complain. 

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_missing.png){width=60% fig-align=center}

### Duplicate

Because the calibration file is not FOV-specific, it will be searched based on the file suffixes only. If there are multiple files that match the same file suffix, FLIM Playground will be confused as which one to use. 

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_duplicate.png){width=60% fig-align=center}

Field of Views with ‚úÖ are loaded successfully üéÜ. FOVs with ‚ùå (if any) will not be recorded.

## Decay Info

If the decay type is [3D/4D decay](data_extraction.qmd#3d4d-decay), FLIM Playground will try to infer the `duration` and the number of `time bins` per laser pulse interval from the decay file metadata. It will also check for inconsistencies across all decay files if there is any. 

### Channel Assignment

If the decay file asscoiated with the channel found by the previous step is a 4D array, then FLIM Playground will try to infer the channal number for that channel. For each channel name, it will list all non-empty channels as potential channel to be assigned. If there is only one, the assignment is automatic. If there are multiple, the user needs to select the channel intended. It will also check for inconsistencies across all decay files about their dimensions and complain if there is any. 

### Reference Dye

If the [reference dye file path](#reference-dye) is specified, FLIM Playground will try to look for and read the file. It expexts a `tiff` or `tif` file that contains a 3D array, with one of them as the time dimension. It will try to match the time dimension with the time dimension of the decay file. If it cannot find the matching time dimension, it will complain. 

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_rd_not_found.png){width=90% fig-align=center}
![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_rd_not_match.png){width=90% fig-align=center}

Once the time axis is matched, the reference dye file path, the reference dye lifetime, and the time axis will be recorded. 

# Export

### Result preview

If there is non-zero number of FOVs with ‚úÖ and channel assignment and reference dye checks (if applicable) are passed, a preview of the metadata data sheet will be shown for the user to check. 

![](extraction_ui_shots/fov_export.png){width=100% fig-align=center}

As an example, the following metadata are extracted: 

- `image_name`: The `image_name` column is the name of each FOV, which is specified in the [fov identifier config](data_extraction_config.qmd#fov-identifier). 
- `nadh_Mask`, `nadh_Decay`, `nadh_IRF`, `fad_Mask`, `fad_Decay`, `fad_IRF`: the [file paths](#fov-file-paths) of the mask, decay, and IRF files for the `nadh` and `fad` channels. 
- `nadh_input_type`, `nadh_imaging_modality`, `fad_input_type`, `fad_imaging_modality`: the [decay type](#decay-type) for each channel. If they share the same imaging modality, the input types should be the same. The only imaging modality supported by FLIM Playground is `FLIM`, therefore the input_type for all channels should be from one of the [decay types](data_extraction_config.qmd#decay-types). 
- `nadh_Lifetime fit free`, `nadh_Intensity morphology`, `nadh_Lifetime fit`,`fad_Intensity morphology`, `fad_Intensity texture`, `fad_Lifetime fit`: [feature extractors](#feature-extractors) for each channel. 
- `nadh_channel`,`duration`, `fad_channel`, `time_bins`, `laser_rate`: the [decay info](#decay-info) for each channel and info shared by all channels. 



The user can click the `Export FOV Metadata as CSV` button to export the metadata to a CSV file.
