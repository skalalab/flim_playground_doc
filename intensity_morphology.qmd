# Morphological Features
FLIM Playground extracts single-cell morphological features based on the cell ROI mask of each *channel*. By inputting the ROI mask to []`skimage.measure.regionprops`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.regionprops), the following features are extracted:

- `area`: the number of pixels in the ROI. 
- `perimeter`: length of the ROI boundary in pixels.

- `solidity`: $\text{Solidity} = \frac{\text{\# ROI pixels}}{\text{\# convex hull pixels}}$, where the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains the ROI. 

- `eccentricity`: the eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same second moments as the region. It is given by the ratio of the focal distance (the distance between the foci) to the length of the major axis:
$e = \frac{c}{a}, \quad e \in [0,1)$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis length, $b$ is the semi-minor axis length, and $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$ is the focal distance. When $e=0$, the ellipse reduces to a circle.

- `major_axis_length`: the length of the major axis of the ellipse that has the same second moments as the region: $2a$. 
- `minor_axis_length`: the length of the minor axis of the ellipse that has the same second moments as the region: $2b$. 
- `circularity`: describes how close the ROI is to a perfect circle. It is defined as $\text{circularity} = \frac{4 \pi A_{\text{ROI}}}{P_{\text{ROI}}^2}, \quad \text{circularity} \in (0,1]$, where $A_{\text{ROI}}$ is the area of the region and $P_{\text{ROI}}$ is its perimeter. A value of $1$ corresponds to a perfect circle.


Features names in the final dataset will have the prefix set to be the combination of the feature extractor name (i.e. `Intensity morphology`) and the channel name, allowing [Data Analysis](data_analysis.qmd) to group the features. For example, `Intensity morphology_nadh: area` means the area of each cell in the NAD(P)H channel.
