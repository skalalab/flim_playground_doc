# Categorical Feature Extraction

Based on the datasets extracted in the [numerical feature extraction](numerical_feature_extraction.qmd) step, FLIM Playground will:

- [merge the datasets](#merging-datasets) into a single dataset
- [assign categorical features](#assigning-categorical-features) to each cell in the merged dataset

## Merging Datasets

It will scan the specified folder path and find all csv files. It will use the [cell identifier column](data_extraction_config.qmd#cell-identifier) to check for duplicates both within each dataset and across all datasets. 

:::{.callout-important #fov-id-categorical}
**The FOV identifier uniquely identifies a field of view and is assumed to contain all information necessary to extract the categorical features (e.g., treatment, time point, etc.), by including segments separated by a certain delimiter (e.g., `_`). Categorical features will be assigned from individual or combined segments.** 
:::

Therefore, it checks if all field of view names include the same number of segments to determine the eligibility of [categorical feature assignment](#assigning-categorical-features).

It will merge the datasets that pass the checks by finding common columns and vertically concatenating them.

## Assigning Categorical Features

Available categorical features to be assigned are drawn from the [user-specified configuration](data_extraction_config.qmd#categorical-features).

Based on the [assumptions](#fov-id-categorical), it will break down the FOV identifier into individual fields and facilitate the assignment.

A live preview of the assignment is shown.

And the merged dataset with categorical features is available for download.
