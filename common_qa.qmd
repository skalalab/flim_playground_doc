# Common Q & A

This chapter addresses frequently asked questions about FLIM Playground.

**Q**: Why I cannot find a certain **numerical feature** under numerical selection/filter widgets? 

**A**: If you cannot find a certain **numerical feature**, try the following:

- look inside the `Uncategorized Features` feature group
- inspect the dataset (e.g., using Excel filters) and look for non-numeric values in that column. One non-numeric value (e.g., "--") will prevent it from being recognized. After clearing those cells (Excel cell not real cells), saving the file, and uploading it again, the feature should be recognized. 

**Q**: Why I cannot find a certain **categorical feature** under categorical filter/visual channel widgets?

**A**: 
- If the uploaded dataset was extracted by [Data Extraction](#sec-data-extraction), FLIM Playground will only match categorical features specified in the [Data Extraction configuration](data_extraction_config.qmd#categorical-features). Otherwise, FLIM Playground will only match categorical features specified in the [configuration](data_analysis_config.qmd#categorical-feature-config). 
    - If the categorical feature was in the corresponding configuration, and it is still not visible:
        - If you just added it, FLIM Playground may not have picked it up yet. Try refreshing the page.
        - If you have already added it, then there is only one unique value in that categorical feature column. FLIM Playground will not show it.

- It is ok if your dataset does not have all of the categorical features specified in either of the configurations. 

**Q**: How do I change the FLIM Playground's display mode (i.e., dark mode or light mode)?

**A**: FLIM Playground uses the browser's current display mode. You can change it by going to the browser's settings and changing the display mode.
