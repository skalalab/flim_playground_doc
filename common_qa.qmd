# Common Q & A

This chapter addresses frequently asked questions about FLIM Playground.

## Feature Missing in Data Analysis

**Q**: Why I cannot find a certain **numerical feature** under numerical selection/filter widgets? 

**A**: If you cannot find a certain **numerical feature**, try the following:

- look inside the `Uncategorized Features` feature group
- inspect the dataset (e.g., using Excel filters) and look for non-numeric values in that column. One non-numeric value (e.g., "--") will prevent it from being recognized. After clearing those cells (Excel cell not real cells), saving the file, and uploading it again, the feature should be recognized. 

**Q**: Why I cannot find a certain **categorical feature** under categorical filter/visual channel widgets?

**A**: FLIM Playground will only match **categorical features** in the uploaded dataset either specified in the [configuration](data_analysis_config.qmd#categorical-feature-config) if the dataset is not extracted by [Data Extraction](#sec-data-extraction), or specified in the [Data Extraction configuration](data_extraction_config.qmd#categorical-features) if the dataset has been extracted by [Data Extraction](#sec-data-extraction). It is ok if your dataset does not have all of the categorical features specified in the configuration.
