# Configuration {#sec-data-analysis-config}
FLIM Playground provides an interactive configuration workflow to help users prepare their datasets that are not extracted by [Data Extraction](#sec-data-extraction) so that they fulfill the [requirements](data_analysis.qmd#requirements). The following sections use the [iris dataset](https://github.com/skalalab/flim_playground/blob/main/demo/iris.csv) as an example: the `flower_id` is added to uniquely identify each row (i.e. a single flower). The other columns are: a categorical feature `species`, and a set of numerical features `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, and `petal_width`.

Specifically, the steps are:

- On the left side of the screen, uncheck `Use Dataset from Data Extraction`.

## Identifiers Config

![](analysis_ui_shots/config_id.png){#id-config width=50% fig-align=center}

- The dataset needs to have a unique identifier column to identify each row. In this case, `flower_id` is the unique identifier column. This dataset does not have a field of view column, so we leave it blank.  

## Categorical Feature Config

- Add categorical columns you want FLIM Playground to recognize here. Those columns are converted to strings internally.

The default categorical feature list does not include `species`, so we add it manually. 

## Numerical Feature Config

![](analysis_ui_shots/config_num.png){width=70%}

- Users can copy the numerical features from Excel or any text editor that opens their CSV files. The features can be separated by `,`, `;`, or whitespaces including newlines. 

- After hitting the `ctrl/cmd + enter` key, the numerical features are parsed and added to `Available Features`. Users can add/delete groups and drag features from the `Available Features` to the groups they've just created. Any ungrouped features are added to a group called `Uncategorized Features`.

### Example

## Save
- After users finish the configuration and click the `Save Configuration` button, FLIM Playground saves the configuration for processing current and future datasets.

## Reset
Users can reset the configuration to the default settings.
