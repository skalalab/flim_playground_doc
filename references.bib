 abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

abstract = {Abstract Autofluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is sensitive to metabolic changes in single cells based on changes in the protein-binding activities of the metabolic co-enzymes NAD(P)H. However, FLIM typically relies on time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) detection electronics on laser-scanning microscopes, which are expensive, low-throughput, and require substantial post-processing time for cell segmentation and analysis. Here, we present a fluorescence lifetime-sensitive flow cytometer that offers the same TCSPC temporal resolution in a flow geometry, with low-cost single-photon excitation sources, a throughput of tens of cells per second, and real-time single-cell analysis. The system uses a 375 nm picosecond-pulsed diode laser operating at 50 MHz, alkali photomultiplier tubes, an FPGA-based time tagger, and can provide real-time phasor-based classification (i.e., gating) of flowing cells. A CMOS camera produces simultaneous brightfield images using far-red illumination. A second PMT provides two-color analysis. Cells are injected into the microfluidic channel using a syringe pump at 2–5 mm/s with nearly 5 ms integration time per cell, resulting in a light dose of 2.65 J/cm2 that is well below damage thresholds (25 J/cm2 at 375 nm). Our results show that cells remain viable after measurement, and the system is sensitive to autofluorescence lifetime changes in Jurkat T cells with metabolic perturbation (sodium cyanide), quiescent versus activated (CD3/CD28/CD2) primary human T cells, and quiescent versus activated primary adult mouse neural stem cells, consistent with prior studies using multiphoton FLIM. This TCSPC-based autofluorescence lifetime flow cytometer provides a valuable label-free method for real-time analysis of single-cell function and metabolism with higher throughput than laser-scanning microscopy systems.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) can probe the metabolic environment of living cells in a label-free and non-invasive manner. However, endogenous fluorophores have low absorption and quantum yields, which necessitates long integration times to acquire the high photon counts needed for accurate pixel-wise multi-exponential decay fitting. Here, we present a {\textquoteleft}region-of-interest{\textquoteright} photon pooling technique to expedite label-free, single cell FLIM acquisition and analysis. As a result, we achieved single-cell metabolic information at intervals as low as one second and acquired large FLIM mosaics 15 times faster than would be possible with conventional pixel-level analysis. This technique is computationally light, does not require machine learning algorithms, and has been integrated with commonly used analysis software and file types.Competing Interest StatementMCS is an adviser to Elephas Biosciences.

    abstract = {Image-based experiments can yield many thousands of individual measurements describing each object of interest, such as cells in microscopy screens. CellProfiler Analyst is a free, open-source software package designed for the exploration of quantitative image-derived data and the training of machine learning classifiers with an intuitive user interface. We have now released CellProfiler Analyst 3.0, which in addition to enhanced performance adds support for neural network classifiers, identifying rare object subsets, and direct transfer of objects of interest from visualization tools into the Classifier tool for use as training data. This release also increases interoperability with the recently released CellProfiler 4, making it easier for users to detect and measure particular classes of objects in their analyses.CellProfiler Analyst binaries for Windows and MacOS are freely available for download at https://cellprofileranalyst.org/. Source code is implemented in Python 3 and is available at https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler-Analyst/.
