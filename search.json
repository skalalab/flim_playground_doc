    "text": "1.2 Introduction\nFluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measures the time it takes for a fluorescent molecule to emit light (return to the ground state) after being excited by a pulse of light (enter the excited state). It is sensitive to changes in fluorophore microenvironment including, pH, temperature, and conformational changes due to protein-binding and the presence of quenchers1. Coupled with modern automated cell-segmentation methods2, FLIM enables single-cell analyses that can reveal biological heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInstrumentation\n\n\n\n\n\nTo acquire FLIM data, a light source—typically a pulsed laser for time-domain methods or a modulated continuous-wave source for frequency-domain methods—is used to excite the fluorophore of interest. The emission is detected using instrumentation capable of resolving fluorescence decay, such as time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), time-gated, or phase/modulation-based detection. In time-domain FLIM, the delay between excitation and photon arrival is measured, and often a histogram is built, with the x-axis representing the delay time and the y-axis representing the number of photons falling into each time bin. Compared to intensity images, FLIM has an additional dimension of time (e.g., 256 time bins per 12.5 nanoseconds).\nIn frequency-domain FLIM, the phase shift and modulation depth of the emission relative to the excitation are determined.",

    "text": "1.3 Challenges\nA diverse set of tools — both open-source and commercial, ranging from libraries to code-free graphical user interfaces (GUIs) — is available to extract and analyze FLIM data, providing alternative methods and therefore flexibility to FLIM researchers. Examples include PhasorPy3, an open-source library for analyzing fluorescence lifetime using the phasor approach; FLUTE4, an open-source GUI for interactive phasor analysis; FLIMPA5, an open-source phasor analysis GUI enabling batch processing, ROI-based quantification, and experiment-level comparison through manual assignment; FLIMLib, an open-source generic curve fitting library that can be used to fit fluorescence lifetime decay data; SPCImage6, a commercial software for fitting and phasor features.\nHowever, while some tools offer code-free interfaces, users still need to write custom code—either to prepare data in the proper format as input, or to further process their outputs for downstream analysis. The fragmentation between tools arises because each focuses on only a subset of data levels: pixel, cell ROI, channel, field of view, and experiment.\n\n1.3.1 Data Levels\n\nPixel:\n\nA single decay curve encoded in vendor-specific file formats (e.g., Becker & Hickl, PicoQuant, etc.)\n\nRegion of Interest (ROI)\n\nMask with cell labels\n\nChannel\n\nDifferent fluorophores\nFluorophore-specific calibration files\nMasks focusing on different parts of the cell (e.g., whole cell, cytoplasm, nucleus, stain, etc.)\nDifferent feature extraction methods (fitting, phasor, morphology, texture)\n\nField of View (FOV)\n\nInput decay types (e.g., 2D, 3/4D, pixel-level lifetime features already fitted)\n\nExperiment\n\nDifferent treatments, time points, cell lines, etc., and combinations thereof\n\n\nAn integrated framework should take into account all data levels ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ (•) while maintaining the flexibility to handle various input types (◦). It should provide a level of abstraction to address fragmentation from data levels and input types.\nAdditionally, the use of FLIM is rapidly evolving, and new methods are being developed all the time. An integrated framework should allow users to choose among alternative methods seamlessly, be the backbone of iterative explorations integral to research, and be ready to incorporate new methods: The provided level of abstraction should address fragmentation from extraction and analysis methods.\nFinally, many of the existing tools, including GUI-based software, are not cross-platform, which limits their accessibility. The Installation addresses this last challenge.\nA closer parallel to FLIM Playground’s integrated approach is the combination of CellProfiler7, which extracts per-object morphological and texture features, and CellProfiler Analyst8, which ingests these outputs or other feature tables for visualization and statistical analysis. However, FLIM Playground stands apart in that it can extract lifetime features from time-resolved data, alongside morphological and texture features from intensity images. Its general Data Analysis section incorporates FLIM-specific methods (e.g., phasor analysis) and provides statistical models that address additional analysis aspects such as data heterogeneity, in addition to training machine learning classifiers.",

It adopts a framework that offers channel-level flexibility in input types and extraction methods without incurring too much overhead for users. Following the above categorization, it is divided into the following steps:\n\nData Extraction Configuration (A): allows users to choose among alternative input types and extraction methods (extractors).\nMetadata organization (B): extracts the field of view identifiers and their configurations\nNumerical Feature Extraction: extracts single-cell numerical features based on user-selected extractors. More extractors can be integrated in the future.\n\nCalibration (C): calibrate for IRF shift or use fluorescence lifetime standard for phasor extraction\nAlternative lifetime extractors (D):\n\nFitting\nPhasor\n\nAlternative intensity-based extractors (D):\n\nMorphology\nTexture\n\n\nCategorical feature extraction (E): extracts single-cell categorical features and combines experiment-level datasets.\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nData Analysis analyzes features—whether extracted through Data Extraction or by other methods—using visualizations and statistical modeling. It deploys a shared framework (F) built to handle the feature classes across all analysis methods, enabling the same interactive and frictionless exploration experience and allowing new methods to be integrated in the future easily.\n\nData Analysis (G) goes in-depth into how FLIM Playground handles the feature classes and Data Analysis Config goes through how users can configure FLIM Playground to analyze datasets that are not extracted by Data Extraction.\n\nHere is the list of analysis methods incorporated into FLIM Playground, grouped by the number of numerical features they take as inputs:\n\nUnivariate analysis\n\nFeature Comparison\nFeature Histogram\nField of View Comparison\n\nBivariate analysis\n\nFeature Distribution\nPhasor Analysis\n\nMultivariate analysis\n\nDimension Reduction\nClassification\n\n\nBoth sections are built in Python and as self-contained executables ready to run on major operating systems and in browsers (H).\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Summary\nFLIM Playground resolves these challenges with an interactive code-free graphical user interface (GUI) that spans the full pipeline. It integrates validation checks that guide users at every step, and has a built-in repertoire of analytical methods with interactive widgets that encourage hypothesis-driven, iterative exploration of large datasets. It is built on a modular architecture that enables incorporation of new algorithms in the future.\n\n\n\n\n1. Datta, R., Heaster, T. M., Sharick, J. T., Gillette, A. A. & Skala, M. C.

Channels can share the same mask, or use different masks (when they use different masks, the mask ID for each cell should match across masks).\nThe cell-level mask can focus on different parts of the cell region, such as the whole cell, the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or the stain part.\nFor an example, see here.\n\n.tiff/.tif: a 2D array with background labeled as 0 and each cell ROI region labeled as a unique positive integer.

Instead, it does cell-level fitting and fit-free (phasor) feature extraction by summing up all the decays belonging to the same cell ROI to get one cell-level decay as a preprocessing step1. It also accepts prefitted pixel-level lifetime features from SPCImage and aggregates pixel-level lifetime features to cell-level lifetime features.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Samimi, K. et al.

    "text": "3.1.1 Categorical Features\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical features are useful to organize the data into groups of interest, and will be used extensively in the Data Analysis section. Users can specify the potential categorical feature names to be extracted in the Categorical Feature Extraction step.\n\n\n3.1.2 Decay Types\nFLIM Playground supports different decay types, including 2D decay, 3D/4D decay, and 3D/4D pixel-prefitted decay, through user specification.\n\n2D Decay\nIn the system developed by Samimi et al.1, single cells flow through and a decay curve is acquired for each cell by aggregating all the photon arrival time delays deemed to be from the same cell. In exchange for spatial distribution, the acquisition speed is increased enormously. The output of the system is a tabular data sheet with each row representing a cell and each column representing a time bin. FLIM Playground currently supports 2D decay in the CSV format.\n\n\n3D/4D Decay\nIn TCSPC-based FLIM, the data is stored in a 3D/4D array and in special format (e.g. .sdt, .ptu). In addition to the spatial dimensions and the time dimension (XYT), the channel dimension may also be present, making it 4-dimensional (CXYT). FLIM Playground currently supports both .sdt and .ptu files up to those 4 dimensions. It reads the duration and the number of time bins from the decay file metadata. Some systems can also record a time stack, which is not supported yet.\n\n\n3D/4D pixel-prefitted\nSince FLIM Playground currently does not support pixel-fitting, users have the option to provide pixel-prefitted outputs from SPCImage in the format of .asc. See here for how FLIM Playground processes SPCImage outputs to obtain cell-level lifetime fitting features.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Identifier\nUsers can specify the column name for the unique identifier of the cell to be stored in the output dataset. The cell identifier is constructed as {FOV Identifier}_{cell_label}, where the cell_label is the unique integer label in the mask or the row number if the decay type is 2D decay.\n\n\nFOV Identifier\nUsers can specify the column name for the field of view identifier. If the decay type is 2D decay, users may want to specify the column name as exp_name, because the FOV is not an image.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Decay Info\n\nLaser frequency\nUsers can specify the laser frequency in GHz. For example, 0.08 GHz equals 80 MHz. It will be used in the phasor analysis. If you do not intend to use the phasor analysis, you can fill in any number.\n\n\n2D Decay-specific\nSince the 2D decay file does not provide the duration and the number of time bins per laser pulse interval, users need to specify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Calibration Method\nIt supports two calibration methods for phasor analysis:\n\nIRF shift-based calibration\nfluorescence lifetime standard-based calibration\n\nSince the instrumental response function (IRF) or the fluorescence lifetime standard is measured for each channel, they are set in the per-channel configurations. The fluorescence lifetime standard’s lifetime is channel-agnostic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Number of Channels\nEach FOV is assumed to have the same number of channels. The configuration will dynamically adjust the per-channel configurations based on the specified number of channels. Currently, the maximum number of channels is 4, and it can be extended to house more channels.",

Currently, two modalities are supported:\n\nFLIM: The signal is time-resolved, i.e., has a time dimension, and is expected to be from one of the decay types.\nIntensity-only: The signal is a spatial map of intensity values (2 spatial dimensions), i.e., has no time dimension. Currently, the only supported signal type is a 2D intensity image in the format of .tiff/.tif.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis setup allows users to image some channels in FLIM mode, and others in non-FLIM mode. It also allows users to extract and analyze their data if they image in non-FLIM microscopic systems such as epifluorescence, confocal, brightfield, etc. by selecting Intensity-only for all channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the decay type is 2D decay, the imaging modality for all channels is restricted to FLIM.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Feature Extractor\nFour types of feature extractors are available if the imaging modality is FLIM:\n\nLifetime fit\nLifetime fit free\nIntensity Morphology\nIntensity Texture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the decay type is 2D decay, the Intensity Morphology and Intensity Texture feature extractors are not applicable.\n\n\nThe Intensity Morphology and Intensity Texture feature extractors are available if the imaging modality is Intensity-only.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach channel can be assigned its own set of feature extractors. For example, if users do not intend to do lifetime extraction, they can de-select the Lifetime fit and Lifetime fit free options.\n\n\n3.2.4 Number of Components\nIf users select the Lifetime fit under this channel, they can specify the number of components to fit.\n\n\n3.2.5 File Suffix\nThe FOV Metadata Organization step looks for associated input files for all channels of a given FOV using file suffixes. Based on the decay type, calibration method, and the selected feature extractors, the system automatically generates the file suffixes for required input files.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, channels nadh and fad were asked to provide an IRF file, while channel cd8 did not, because Lifetime fit was selected for the former two channels and not for the latter. The file suffixes of the IRF files were different for each of the two channels, but they shared the same ROI mask file suffix because they used the same ROI mask. The cd8 channel used a different ROI mask than the other two channels, indicated by the mask file suffix.\nFor detailed information on what file formats are supported for each file type (Mask, IRF, etc.), see input file types.\nFor detailed information on how the file suffixes are used, and what each file type (e.g. IRF, Mask, etc.) is, see the FOV Metadata Organization page.",

It will also check for inconsistencies across all decay files.\n\nChannel Assignment\nIf the decay file associated with the channel found by the previous step is a 4D array, then FLIM Playground will try to infer the channel number for that channel. For each channel name, it will list all non-empty channels as potential channels to be assigned. If there is only one, the assignment is automatic. If there are multiple, users need to select the channel intended. It will also check for inconsistencies across all decay files about their dimensions and complain if there are any.\n\n\nFluorescence Lifetime Standard\nIf the file path to the fluorescence lifetime standard is specified, FLIM Playground will try to look for and read the file. It expects a tiff or tif file that contains a 3D array, with one of them as the time dimension. It will try to match the time dimension with the time dimension of the decay file.

    "section": "5.2 Calibration",
    "text": "5.2 Calibration\nCalibration in FLIM is essential because raw decays are convolved with the instrument response function (IRF)—the timing profile of the detection system’s response to an ultrashort light pulse that broadens and shifts the measured decay—so without correcting for these, fitted lifetimes and phasor positions are biased and not comparable across days, samples, or instruments.\n\n5.2.1 Fit Calibration\nDuring different experiments, the IRF may shift differently with respect to the measured decay. Before applying reconvolution fitting, the IRF shift needs to be estimated for each channel if the Lifetime fit feature extractor is selected for the channel.\nIt is performed in two steps:\n\nGather the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decay curves\nFor each curve, perform reconvolution fitting and set the shift value as the free parameter to be optimized/fitted.\n\nThe distribution of the shift values is displayed as an interactive scatter plot. When clicking on a point, the corresponding decay curve with the fitted curve and the key statistics are displayed for diagnostics. Based on the distribution or using certain prior knowledge, users can specify the shift value applied to all fields of view (if Fix the Shift is selected, see fitting options), or use the fov-specific shift value found by the fitting (if Fix the Shift is deselected).\n\n\nGather High SNR Decay Curves\nThe high SNR decay curves are constructed automatically based on the decay type. If it is in 2D format, a total of the brightest 30 curves that are below 100000 photons are selected and evenly distributed across all fields of view (one CSV file is considered as one FOV). If it is in 3D/4D format, the fields of view are images, and one curve is constructed for each image that includes all the non-zero pixels within the ROI mask.\n\n\nReconvolution Fitting\nFitting is essentially an optimization problem: it minimizes the difference between the fitted curve and the measured curve. The fitted curve is modeled by an \\(n^{th}\\) component exponential function convolved with the shifted IRF, and the difference is modeled as an objective metric. Therefore, users are provided with controls over two parts of the fitting process through the fitting options panel:\n\nHow to construct the objective metric\nHow to perform the optimization\n\nImplementation-wise, FLIM Playground uses the lmfit package that takes generic objectives to perform the optimization process that is flexible enough to handle the reconvolution fitting.\nIf at least one channel has Lifetime fit feature extractor selected, the fitting options panel is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down the fitting options one by one.\n\nNumber of Components\nThe number \\(n\\) in the \\(n^{th}\\) component exponential function: \\[\nI(\\mathbf{t})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i\\, e^{-\\mathbf{t}/\\tau_i}, \\qquad \\tau_i&gt;0\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(n\\) determines the parameters to be fitted: the amplitudes \\(A_i\\) and the lifetimes \\(\\tau_i\\). \\(\\mathbf{t}\\) is the time axis of the decay curve calculated by the duration and time bins from the decay info: \\[\\mathbf{t}=\\bigl[0,\\ \\Delta t,\\ 2\\Delta t,\\ \\ldots,\\ (N-1)\\Delta t\\bigr],\n\\quad \\text{where }\\Delta t=\\frac{T}{N}.\n\\]\nIt supports \\(n=1,2,3\\) components.\nAdditionally, the constant offset parameter (\\(Z\\)) that represents a time-independent background (i.e., room light) is also optimized1.\n\\[\n\\hat{y}(t) = [I(t) \\otimes \\text{IRF}(t)] + Z\n\\]\n\n\nTime Gates\nDue to the dead time of the system certain time bins from the head and/or tail of the decay curve are not reliable. The T1 (head) and T2 (tail) gates are used to select the time range of the decay curve to be fitted. Users can inspect the decay curve by clicking the full-screen mode button of the plot on the right of the shift result. Hover-based interaction is implemented so users can see the time bin numbers to have a better sense of the time range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the time bins within the T1 and T2 gates are used to calculate the cost metric.\n\n\nMetric\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) estimates the parameters by maximizing the likelihood function, which is the probability of the measured data given the model parameters. A mathematically convenient way to do this is to minimize the negative log-likelihood function:\n\\[\n\\text{NLL}(\\theta; t_s,t_e)\n= -\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\mathbf{1}_{[t_s,t_e]}(t_n)\\,\\bigl[y_n \\log \\hat{y}(t_n) - \\hat{y}(t_n)\\bigr].\n\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{1}_{[t_s,t_e]}\\) is the indicator function that is 1 if \\(t_n\\) is within the time gates \\([t_s, t_e]\\), and 0 otherwise. \\(y_n\\) is the observed count at time \\(t_n\\), and \\(\\hat{y}(t_n)\\) is the model prediction at \\(t_n\\).\nLeast Squares (LS) estimates the parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the measured curve and the model prediction.\n\n\nFitting Mode\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter constructing the objective metric, the fitting mode is used to determine the optimization algorithm. It is a trade-off between the speed and the effort to avoid local minima.\n\nGlobal: It uses the differential evolution algorithm, a derivative-free, population-based but slow global optimizer.\nLocal: It uses the leastsq (least squares with Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm if the chosen metric is LS, otherwise it uses the nelder (Nelder-Mead) algorithm.\n\nHybrid: The most time-consuming option but combines the best of both worlds. It uses the differential evolution to find a good initial guess to all the parameters, and then uses the Local to drill in.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Fit Free Calibration\nUsers get to choose between the following two methods to calibrate the IRF shift in the configuration step.\nThe first step of the calibration is to subtract an offset value and clip each decay curve to 0 if the time bin is negative. The offset \\(C\\) is estimated as the mean signal over the final 10% of time bins in each decay (‘tail’).\nThen, depending on the chosen calibration method, the following two methods are available:\n\nShift IRF\nIt is performed similarly to the fit calibration steps, but in the second step, the shift is not optimized (fitted). It shares the same interface as the fit calibration step, where a scatter plot of the shift values is displayed for each channel, only that the plot is not interactive to show the fit. Instead, it outputs the shift that maximizes the cross-correlation between the IRF and each decay. If Fix the Shift is selected, users can specify the shift value that will be applied to all fields of view. Otherwise, the shift value is chosen to be the one that maximizes the cross-correlation between the IRF and the decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf both the Lifetime fit and Lifetime fit free feature extractors are selected for this channel, the optimized IRF shift derived from the fit calibration step is reused for the Lifetime fit free feature extractor.\n\n\nThe signals of the shifted IRF are deconvolved from the offset-subtracted decay curves using phasor.phasor_divide from the phasorpy package.\n\n\nFluorescence lifetime standard\nBecause the fluorescence lifetime standard is measured in the same system as the decay curves and we know its lifetime, there is no need to account for the IRF shift and the offset. Therefore, after subtracting the offset, phasorpy’s lifetime.phasor_calibrate function is used to calibrate all the decay curves behind the scenes when calculating the phasor coordinates.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Confirm Calibration\nOnce users are satisfied with the calibration settings (fitting options and shift values), they can click the Confirm Calibration button at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce confirmed, the left panel prompts users to either apply the calibration settings to the downstream extractors or calibrate again. Users can also save the updated settings (fitting options and shift values) to the metadata file.",

    "text": "6.1 Fitting\nBiological samples often contain mixtures of fluorescent species, each with its own characteristic lifetime.

To recap, the reconvolution fitting minimizes the difference between the measured curve and the fitted curve modeled by a multi-exponential model convolved with the IRF, quantified by the cost metric.\nOtherwise, FLIM Playground uses the pre-fitted values to calculate the fitting features.\nIn the final dataset, fitting features are prefixed by the combination of the feature extractor name (i.e. Lifetime fit) and the channel name, allowing Data Analysis to group the features.

The ROI summing reduces variability and bias and allows for short integration times at acquisition in exchange for sub-cellular resolution (i.e., pixel-level). Users do not need to specify the bin factor (each pixel sums up the surrounding pixels’ decay curves) to account for insufficient photon counts. Also, this summing lets a single-threaded CPU application finish in a reasonable amount of time.\nIt also shifts the IRF using the shift values from the IRF shift calibration step.

So, their calculation is frequency (\\(f\\)) and time (\\(T\\)) independent. However, there are cases when the decay curve is truncated due to the deadtime of the system. For example, when the laser frequency is \\(f = 0.08\\) GHz, the theoretical period is \\(T = 12.5\\) ns, but in practice the time window is truncated to \\(T = 10\\) ns. FLIM Playground applies a custom implementation to the truncated decay curve. (The sample_phase option can be used to account for the truncation but it does not handle the second or higher harmonics)\n\nUntruncated decay curve\nIt uses the phasor_from_signal function from the phasorpy package to calculate the uncalibrated phasor coordinates g_raw and s_raw, g_raw_2nd and s_raw_2nd, the first and second harmonics’ real and imaginary parts, from the cell decay curve.\nEither g_irf, s_irf, g_irf_2nd, and s_irf_2nd from the IRF, or ref_mean, ref_real, ref_imag from the fluorescence lifetime standard, depending on the chosen calibration method, are calculated using the same function.\nMathematically, the raw phasor coordinates are calculated as (copied from the phasorpy documentation):\n\\[\nF_{\\mathrm{DC}}=\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}F_k,\\quad\ng_{\\mathrm{raw}}=\\frac{1}{F_{\\mathrm{DC}}}\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}F_k\\cos\\!\\left(2\\pi h \\frac{k}{K}\\right),\\quad\ns_{\\mathrm{raw}}=\\frac{1}{F_{\\mathrm{DC}}}\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}F_k\\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi h \\frac{k}{K}\\right)\n\\] where \\(K\\) is the number of time bins, \\(F_k\\) is the decay curve, and \\(h\\) is the harmonic number.\n\n\nTruncated decay curve\nThe phasor coordinates of the IRF and the decay curves of both harmonics are calculated using the time axis \\(t_k = k\\,(T/K)\\;\\;(k=0,\\ldots,K-1)\\) and the angular frequency \\(\\omega = 2\\pi\\,hf\\):\n\\[\ng_{\\mathrm{raw}}\n=\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} F_k \\cos\\!\\big(\\omega\\, t_k\\big)}\n        {\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} F_k},\\quad\ns_{\\mathrm{raw}}\n=\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} F_k \\sin\\!\\big(\\omega\\, t_k\\big)}\n        {\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} F_k}\n\\]\nThis formula is equivalent to the untruncated formula when \\(fT = 1\\).\nFor the fluorescence lifetime standard, the phasor coordinates are calculated using phasorpy’s phasor_from_signal and the sample_phase option is set to \\(\\omega t_k\\).\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Step 2: calibrated phasor coordinates\nTo get the calibrated phasor coordinates g, s, g_2nd, and s_2nd, FLIM Playground uses either\nfrom phasorpy import phasor\ng, s = phasor.phasor_divide(g_raw, s_raw, g_irf, s_irf)\ng_2nd, s_2nd = phasor.phasor_divide(g_raw_2nd, s_raw_2nd, g_irf_2nd, s_irf_2nd)\nor\nfrom phasorpy import lifetime\ng, s = lifetime.phasor_calibrate(g_raw, s_raw, ref_mean, ref_real, ref_imag, frequency=laser_rate, lifetime=reference_dye_lifetime)\ng_2nd, s_2nd = lifetime.phasor_calibrate(g_raw_2nd, s_raw_2nd, ref_mean, ref_real, ref_imag, frequency=laser_rate, lifetime=reference_dye_lifetime, harmonic=2)\nThe laser_rate is specified during the fov metadata extraction and the configuration interface.\n\n\n7.2.3 Step 3: phasor-derived lifetime\nTau_phase and Tau_m are calculated using the first harmonic’s phasor coordinates g and s.\nimport numpy as np\nw = 2 * np.pi * laser_rate\nphi = np.arctan2(s, g) \nm = np.sqrt(g**2 + s**2)\ntau_phase = 1/w * np.tan(phi)\ntau_m = 1/w * np.sqrt(1/m**2 - 1)\n\\[\n\\phi = \\operatorname{atan2}(s,\\,g), m = \\sqrt{g^{2}+s^{2}}, \\tau_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\tan \\phi}{\\omega}, \\tau_{m} = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m^{2}}-1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "11.3 Shared Interactive Widgets\nA list of shared widgets is provided to support the general workflow in analysis.\n\n11.3.1 General Workflow\n\nselect numerical feature(s) on the left\nsubset the data to find data of interest on the top\nuse visual channels widgets to look at the data in different ways\nchange the plot style\nhover to find data points of interest\n\nThe visualization and analysis results are updated in real time to reflect users’ interactions with any of the above widgets.\n\n\n11.3.2 Numerical Feature Widgets\nThe Data Extraction recognizes numerical features using pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype internally. Then it groups numerical features based on the feature extractor type and the channel it belongs to. For user-provided datasets, the numerical features are grouped based on the user-specified configuration. Ungrouped numerical features are put into the Uncategorized Features group. One selection widget is rendered for each numerical feature group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you cannot find a certain numerical feature under any numerical widgets including Uncategorized Features, please inspect the dataset (e.g., using Excel filters) and look for non-numeric values in that column. One non-numeric value (e.g., “–”) will prevent it from being recognized.\n\n\n\nUnivariate Analysis\nOne single-select widget is rendered per group; choosing a feature in any group clears the selections and resets the others to Select.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate Analysis\nTwo sets of selection widgets are rendered to allow maximum flexibility (the two features can be from the same or different feature groups). Each set of selection widgets behaves like the selection widgets in the univariate analysis. The first selected feature will be hidden in the second set of selection widgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultivariate Analysis\nOne set of selection widgets, each can select multiple features from a feature group, is rendered. A special value All is introduced so that users can conveniently select all features under the feature group. If users select All, all the other options will be cleared, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Categorical Feature Widgets\nFLIM Playground recognizes the categorical features in the uploaded dataset based on the user-specified configuration if the dataset is not extracted by Data Extraction. Otherwise, it recognizes categorical features specified in the Data Extraction configuration.\n\nFilter Widgets\n\nFor complex datasets that are collected over multiple days, experiments, treatments, etc., it is useful to filter the data to focus on a subset of the data (data of interest). One filter widget is rendered for each categorical feature so that users have the flexibility to filter the data based on combinations of categorical features. All is a special option that include all categories of the selected categorical feature. Once it is selected, all the other options are cleared, and vice versa.\n\n\nVisual Channels Widgets\n\nHuman vision is wired for rapid, parallel pattern and trend detection; good visual encodings (how to map data to visual elements such as color, shape, opacity, etc.) harness this to surface insights that raw numbers or text obscure1. FLIM Playground provides color, opacity, and shape channels for visualizations that support them:\n\nColor by\nColor is supported in all methods except for Classification. In Color by, users can select multiple categorical features, and each unique combination of available categories (determined by the filters in the Filter Widgets) in selected features is assigned a distinct color. Groups created by Color by show up in the x-axis (if multiple features, categories from each feature are delimited by ::).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 11.1: How to order the groups\n\n\n\nThe order of the groups in x-axis and in the legend is determined by:\n\nthe order of the selected features: categories of the first feature appear before those of the second, and so on and so forth. For example, the two treatments of Panc1 are together, because it is sorted first on the cell lines, then on treatments. If you want the treatments to be together, in Color by you can select treatment then cell_line.\nNumeric-alphabetical sort: within each feature, the category order is determined by the number inside (e.g. 1 in Panc1) first, then the alphabetical order of the category name. Therefore, although P is after M alphabetically, the 1 is before 7 numerically, making Panc1 appear before MCF7. This may be helpful when you have data from different days or hours. The default string sort will put Day 100 before Day 30, and this is not what we want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpacity and Shape by\n\nOpacity and shape are supported in all point-based visualizations (e.g. Feature Comparison, 2D Feature Distribution, Phasor Analysis, Dimension Reduction). In Opacity by and Shape by, users can select one categorical feature, and each unique category is assigned a distinct opacity or shape. The order of the shape and opacity is also sorted numeric-alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Unique ID Hover\n\nIn all point-based visualizations, when hovering over a point, the unique id of the point will be shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.5 Plotting Configuration Widgets\n\nUsers can interactively configure the following plot parameters:\n\npoint size (if point-based)\naxis label size\nlegend size\nthe colormap used to color different groups\n\ncolorblind, tab10, tab20, Set1, Set2, Set3, Pastel1, Pastel2, Accent, viridis, plasma, inferno, magma, cividis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

By estimating the component parameters and their weights (mixing coefficients) from the data—commonly using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm—GMMs can capture complex, multimodal distributions that a single Gaussian cannot.\n\n14.3.1 Fit Gaussian Mixture Models\n\n\n\nGaussian Mixture Model Configuration\n\n\n\nFits GMMs on the selected numerical feature up to Max Components components, each of which has its component weights (\\(w_i\\)), means (\\(\\mu_i\\)) and variances (\\(\\sigma_i^2\\)).\nRetains only valid models in which every component has weight at least Min Weight Threshold (the weights of all components add to 1).\nFLIM Playground will choose the valid model with the lowest BIC score that penalizes the model complexity to avoid overfitting.\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Heterogeneity index\nTo quantify the subpopulation structure, based on the GMM fit, FLIM Playground computes an “H‑index” for each group as a weighted entropy‑distance: each component contributes according to its weight’s uncertainty (\\(-w_i \\log w_i\\))2 scaled by how far its mean \\(\\mu_i\\) sits from the overall mixture mean \\(\\bar\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i\\,\\mu_i\\), normalized by the standard deviation of \\(\\mu_i\\)s.\n\\[\nH =\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\bigl(-w_i \\log w_i\\bigr)\\,d_i, \\qquad d_i \\;=\\;\n\\frac{\\lvert\\mu_i - \\bar{\\mu}\\rvert}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\n\n14.3.3 Classification\n\nUsers can choose to perform intersection thresholding or hard assignment to determine which GMM component each data point belongs to. It appends a new categorical feature column called GMM_Group (recognizable by methods in Data Analysis as a categorical feature) to the filtered dataset, the values of which are {color_group}_1, {color_group}_2, etc. In the example above, the color groups were created by 0.5hr and 4.5hr because the user colored the data by hour. The classification result can be saved by clicking:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntersection thresholding\n\nOnce the GMM is estimated, thresholds can be obtained by locating the intersection points of adjacent component densities: \\[\n                      w_1\\,\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)\n                      \\;=\\;\n                      w_2\\,\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu_2,\\sigma_2^2)\n                      \\] where \\(w_1, \\mu_1, \\sigma_1\\) are the mixture weight, mean, and standard deviation of the first Gaussian component, respectively, and \\(w_2, \\mu_2, \\sigma_2\\) those of the second component.\nThe above equation can be formed as a quadratic equation and solved for the unique root lying between \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\). In practice, we bracket this interval and apply a robust one‐dimensional root-finding routine (e.g. Brent’s method) to compute intersection points. Data points are then assigned to the class corresponding to the interval in which they fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn rare cases when there is more than one intersection point, the data point is assigned using hard assignment rather than intersection thresholding.\n\n\n\n\nHard assignment\n\nFor each data point, it computes the posterior probability (responsibility) of each component, and assigns the data point to the component with the highest responsibility.\n\n\\[\\text{label}(x) = \\arg\\max_{i} \\gamma_i(x)\\]\n\\[\\text{where} \\quad \\gamma_i(x) = \\frac{w_i \\; \\mathcal{N}\\bigl(x \\mid \\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2\\bigr)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K w_j \\; \\mathcal{N}\\bigl(x \\mid \\mu_j, \\sigma_j^2\\bigr)}\\]\n\n\n\n14.3.4 Example\nPham et al. used GMM with hard thresholding to create gates using NAD(P)H \\(a_1\\) and optical redox ratio. These gates were used to define metabolically stressed and fit cells in their study of the impact of cryopreservation on T cell metabolism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey compared the GMM-derived gate with cell viability by Trypan blue staining:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt suggests that optical metabolic imaging (OMI) could serve as an early, non-destructive indicator of T cell viability post-thaw.\n\n\n\n\n1.

They are more flexible and can handle non-linear relationships between features, but they are more computationally expensive, less interpretable, not deterministic (FLIM Playground uses the random seed 42 to ensure reproducibility), and dependent on the hyperparameters.

This module provides a set of machine learning classifiers and interactive widgets to help users perform classification.\nAll the classifiers are implemented using scikit-learn and the performance metrics are calculated using sklearn.metrics. A fixed random seed (42) is used for all the classifiers to ensure reproducibility.\nThe performance metric plots are cut off in the screenshot.

    "text": "19.2 Method-specific Components\n\nChoose the classifier and train-test split: the slider controls the proportion of the data used to train the classifier and the rest is used as unseen data to test its generalizability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassify by: The Color by from the visual channels widgets is renamed to Classify by and it is used to form classes based on (a combination of) selected categorical features. Other visual channels are not supported in this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the classes to be classified: classes are formed based on the combinations of categories of the selected categorical features. In general, it supports binary classification and in general n-way classification where n is the number of classes. If one categorical feature is selected and after filtering has 3 categories, then all possible ways to classify are produced including the three-way classification. Additionally, the class x vs the rest option is provided for each class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling methods:\n\nNone: stratified random sampling of the data on classification classes, regardless of the class size. It is implemented using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.\nUndersampling: All classes are downsampled to the size of the smallest class. It is implemented using RandomUnderSampler from imbalanced-learn.\nOversampling: All classes are upsampled to the size of the largest class by randomly duplicating samples from minority classes. It is implemented using RandomOverSampler from imbalanced-learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFLIM Playground applies the z-score normalization to the features before training if the chosen classifier is SVM or Logistic Regression, because they are sensitive to feature magnitudes, while Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are not.\n\n\n\n19.2.1 Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of the classifiers, performance metrics visualizations are provided.\n\nConfusion Matrix\nFLIM Playground evaluates the trained classifier on the held-out test set and summarizes its predictions with sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix. In the binary case, it is represented as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted Positive\nPredicted Negative\n\n\n\n\nActual Positive\nTrue Positive (TP) – correct hits\nFalse Negative (FN) – missed positives\n\n\nActual Negative\nFalse Positive (FP) – false alarms\nTrue Negative (TN) – correct rejections\n\n\n\nOther metrics can be calculated based on the confusion matrix:\n\nAccuracy: \\(\\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}\\)\nPrecision: \\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\\)\nRecall (Sensitivity): \\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\\)\nF1 Score: \\(\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROC Curve\nAnother way to look at the performance of the classifier is to plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and its Area Under the Curve (AUC).\nA classifier usually outputs a score for each sample. To turn scores into hard labels, a decision threshold must be chosen. Confusion matrix looks at the performance of the classifier at a single threshold (in the binary case, the threshold is 0.5), while ROC curve looks at the performance of the classifier at all thresholds (from 0 to 1).\nAt the origin (0, 0), the threshold is 1, so the classifier predicts all samples as negative, making the false positive rate \\(\\text{FPR} = \\frac{\\text{FP}}{\\text{FP} + \\text{TN}} = 0\\) and the true positive rate \\(\\text{TPR} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}} = 0\\), i.e. the origin. At the point (1, 1), the threshold is 0, so the classifier predicts all samples as positive, making the false positive rate 1 and the true positive rate 1, i.e. the point (1, 1).\nAUC summarizes the ROC curve by integrating it from 0 to 1, so it is threshold-free and has a nice interpretation: it is the probability that the classifier assigns a higher score to a randomly chosen positive sample \\(X^+\\) than to a randomly chosen negative sample \\(X^-\\).\nTo generalize to the \\(K\\)-class cases (\\(K &gt; 2\\)), FLIM Playground chooses the One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy. For each class \\(i\\), it trains a binary classifier to predict the class \\(i\\) against all other classes. The ROC curve is then computed and plotted for each class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Importance\nRandom Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers provide feature importance scores.",
